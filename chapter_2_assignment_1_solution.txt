INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,2,'AC')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,3,'AC')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,4,'AF')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,5,'B')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,6,'D')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,7,'BDEF')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,8,'ADEF')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,9,'X')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,10,'X')
INTO CLASS_ASSIGNMENTS VALUES (2,1,11,'X')

	ANSWER		VARCHAR2(6)
)
TABLESPACE USERS
PARALLEL(DEGREE 2)
PCTFREE 10;

CREATE TABLE HOMEWORK (
	CHAPTER	NUMBER NOT NULL,
